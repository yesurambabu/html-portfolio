<p>This is a great film by S. S. Rajamouli. Both parts were amazing and the acting by Prabhas was like never before ever after. He acted in such a way that no one in the entire world can replace that character apart from Prabhas.</p>
<h3>Pushpa The Rise:</h3>

<p>This is my favourite movie. I love the way Sukumar and Allu Arjun worked to make that masterpeice which proved by bringing the National Award for Allu Arjuns best acting.</p>
<h3>Animal Part 1:</h3>

<p>This is also my facourite movie. The way of taking the movie by the Sandeep Reddy Vanga was astonishing. Also the unexpected mesmerising performance of Ranbir Kapoor was also astonishing.</p>
